### Getting started

- Fork the repo
- Clone your fork
- Install the packages: `yarn install`
- Run the demo: `yarn develop`

To be able to have both the demo and plugin in the same repo we use [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/).

- Plugin code is in the `/plugin` folder,
- and the demo code is in the `/demo` folder.
