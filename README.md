# @raae/gatsby-plugin-svg-emoji-favicon

_Use an emoji as your site's svg favicon_ ðŸ–¼

The plugin uses a trick I learned via [@chriscoyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier) on [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/emojis-as-favicons/) who got it from [@LeaVerou](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1241619866475474946); the emoji is placed inside an svg tag and the svg is used as the favicon.
